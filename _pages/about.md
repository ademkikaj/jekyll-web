Hi, I am Adem, a PhD student at [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/kuleuven/) and a researcher at the [DTAI](https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/) research group.

My research focuses on the _integration of graph neural networks with probabilistic logic programming_. 

My main research interests are in graph neural networks, (probabilistic) logic programming, and neurosymbolic AI.

My PhD research is part of the [iBOF](https://ai.kuleuven.be/news/luc-de-raedt-jesse-davis-ku-leuven-and-tijl-de-bie-ugent-one-of-the-first-15-ibof-projects) project where I work under the supervision of [Prof. Luc De Raedt](https://wms.cs.kuleuven.be/people/lucderaedt/) and [Asst. Prof. Giuseppe Marra](https://www.giuseppemarra.com/).

Before joining KU Leuven, I was a research member at the [Knowledge Technologies](https://kt.ijs.si/) department at [Jožef Stefan Institute](https://ijs.si/ijsw/V001/JSI), working with [Prof. Marko Bohanec](http://kt.ijs.si/MarkoBohanec/mare.html), where I also obtained my MSc with a focus on decision-support systems.
